# Project - Banking App

## Scenario
- The user is a bank employee who manually manages the bank's accounts. 
- He does the creation of account manually using the account holders name and sets the initial balance of the account if possible. 
- He also does the withdrawal and deposit manually for each account. 
- He also does the transfer of balances if there are requests for it. 
- Your task is to help this poor employee out by creating a simple admin banking app.

## Objective
Create a simple Banking Javascript App

## Requirements
HTML/CSSJavascript

## Objective
- app should have a page to display all users (can be a table where the name and balance are visible)
- app should have a page for creating a userapp should have a page for deposit/withdraw/transfer (can be separate or in one page)
- all design features will depend on YOUR IDEAS.

## Functions
Here are the required functions:

- [ ] create_user(user, balance)
   - function creates new user in the system
   - New user has zero balance (or an optional initial balance)
   - user (argument) is any string value

- [ ] deposit(user, amount)
   - increases user's balance by amount value
   - returns new_balance of the user

- [ ] withdraw(user, amount)
   - decreases user's balance by amount value
   - returns new_balance of the user

- [ ] send(from_user, to_user, amount)
   - decreases from_user's balance by amount value
   - increases to_user's balance in amount value
   - returns balance of from_user and to_user in given format

- [ ] get_balance(user)
   - returns balance of the user in given format (‚Ç±xx,xxx.xx or Phpxx,xxx.xx)
   
- [ ] list_users()
   - returns all users

## Error Handling

- [ ] wrong_arguments
   - e.g. amount cannot be negative, name cannot start with a number

- [ ] user_already_exists 
   - ('Den' == 'den')

- [ ] user_does_not_exists

- [ ] not_enough_money

- [ ] sender_does_not_exists

- [ ] receiver_does_not_exists

## Use localStorage
- You may use a button somewhere in your application page that when pressed should load the initial data to the localStorage
- This will help you, and other visitors on you Github Page, to immediately test the capabilities of your banking app
- Note: localStorage across different pages will only work on your Github Pages because it depends on the domain.

## Something Unique...
- Create at least 3 features unique to your banking app
- The feature should make it convenient for the user to use your app
- It can be a graph of some sort?
- It can be a totally new page that does another thing?
- Or just surprise us... üòèüòèüòè

## Presentation
- You will be presenting your Banking app starting 6 December 2021.
- Guide to the presentation:
   - Demo the basic functionality, then point out the unique features. 
   - Every item in the Errors slide should be handled
   - What were the challenges your duo faced?
   - How did you come up with your app's unique features? (Maybe inspired by another app?)
